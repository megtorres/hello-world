# hello-world
Place to keep my projects :)
Hi there! My name is Meg Torres and I'm teaching myself to code and am also learning about web development and other computer science. 
I'm currently focusing my learning on HTML and CSS, but will later move on to Javascript, React.js, Python, and more.
Feel free to follow my adventures as I create some of my own projects! :)
