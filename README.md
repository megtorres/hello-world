# hello-world
<h1><strong>Place to keep my projects :)</strong></h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Meg Torres and I'm teaching myself to code and am also learning about web development and other computer science.<br>
I'm currently focusing my learning on HTML and CSS, but will later move on to Javascript, React.js, Python, and more.<br>
Feel free to follow my adventures as I create some of my own projects!</p>
